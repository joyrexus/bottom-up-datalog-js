# What it is

A short and simple (and horribly inefficient) bottom-up implementation of Datalog in javascript with [heavy code commentary](http://joyrexus.github.io/datalog.js/).


## Wait, what is Datalog?

[Datalog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) is a logical query language. It exists somewhere between relational algebra (the formal theory behind SQL) and Prolog, but is closer in motivation to the former than the later. It was invented to apply some of the principles of logic programming to database theory. Its primary addition to the semantics of databases is recursive queries.


## Implementation

Right now every query simply builds up a complete database of facts first, by taking each applicable rule, matching it against the known facts and then adding the solutions (if any) to the existing facts. This is repeated as long as new facts can be added this way and then the database is complete. Now we only need to check if our query unifies with any fact. Sounds not exactly smart? It isn't. But it's simple and easy to understand.

  goal of the book is to help the functional programmer think logically and 
  the logic programmer think functionally. The authors believe that logic   
  programming is a natural extension of functional programming, and they 
  demonstrate this by extending the Scheme with logical constructs â€” thereby 
  combining the benefits of both styles. The extension encapsulates most of 
  the ideas in Prolog.
